# Hangman-Game

## Overview

For project #1, I created the simple game of 'Hangman'!

Once players come to the site, they will see a keyboard on the page. Below the keyboard, the drawing of a 'hangman' appears. As the player guesses letters, the correct lettter appears on the dashes. When the user guesses an incorrect letter, a different part of the 'hangman' appears. If the player wins, 'You Win' appears. If the player loses, the full drawing of the 'hangman' and 'Game Over' appears on the page. The user may also click on the 'Hint' button for a hint and 'Play Again' button.
